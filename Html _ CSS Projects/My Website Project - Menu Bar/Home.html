            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="aboutMe">I am currently attending Yukon High School. My favorite subject is Computer Science. Some of my hobbies are playing video games, coding, and reading. I play Overwatch for a youth esports org called OATH League. I am one of the supports on Team Crewtons. I also like to play Tetris competitively. I started programming in the fifth grade, where I coded bot balls. I would then start coding a lot more around 8th grade. In my freshmen and sophomore year, I took programming classes, I learned python and Java in these classes. I also took a cybersecurity class. One of my favorite books of all time is The Outsiders. A book I want to read is Alice Isn't Dead. In the future I would like to go to college for Computer Science. </p>
